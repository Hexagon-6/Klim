/* add a transition for the "current" class so it slowly fades to be like the not-focused "hours". For the movement, add a transition for translation and modify 
the translate property from js; when the transition is finished, replace the elements in their current, translated positions, since they will have already moved to 
their corresponding spaces, there will be no visual difference in this process. As for the sides, you can make an "hour" clone and place it to the right (translated),
hiding it with overflow:hidden */
